                        explanation: "Différance is Derrida's neologism combining 'to differ' and 'to defer.' It describes how meaning is never present but is endlessly deferred through chains of signification, where each sign refers to other signs rather than to a stable referent."

This is a misrecognition (méconnaissance) because the image is more coherent than the infant's actual fragmented experience."

This discourse served to justify and maintain Western imperial control over Eastern societies."

                        explanation: "Spivak argues that the subaltern (marginalized groups, particularly colonized women) cannot speak in their own voice because their expression is always mediated through dominant Western intellectual frameworks, which inevitably distort or silence their authentic experience."

                        explanation: "Bhabha's concept of hybridity describes how colonial discourse, in attempting to define and control the colonized, inevitably produces mixed, ambivalent cultural forms that undermine the colonizer's authority and create spaces for resistance and new identities."
